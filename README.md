# Single_Cycle_Mips_Processor
MIPS-32 CPU using VHDL &amp; ModelSim

Along with Trey Harper and Timothy Koh, we developed a complete VHDL description of the MIPS-32 CPU and simulated it by 
executing a set of programs to demonstrate correct functionality of the processor.

The simulation, debugging, and testing of the VHDL code were done in ModelSim.
